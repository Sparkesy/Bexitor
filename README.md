# Bexitor
Welcome to Bexitor, a basic text editor for Windows, similar to Microsoft's Notepad. If you would like a compiled version or an installer, you can find it at my website: http://matthew28845.x10.mx/work.html

## FAQ

### Why is there no RTF support?

There is no RTF support because Bexitor is designed to edit any file directly, not view it. .TXT files are the exception here.

### I already have Notepad, why should I go to the trouble of installing Bexitor?

There's a good reason for that: Everyone has Notepad, but not everyone has Bexitor.
